# Neural-Network-in-Python
(Deep) Neural Network implementation in Python

## Introduction
This is CS5242 assignment one in National University of Singapore. The requirement are coding and training multilayer fully conncected neural networks in Python, and checking the gradients of parameters. Please see [Question](https://github.com/coldmanck/CS5242-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning-Assignments/blob/master/assignment1/assignment01.pdf) for reference. Also see my [code](https://github.com/coldmanck/Neural-Network-in-Python/tree/master/code), [results](https://github.com/coldmanck/CS5242-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning-Assignments/tree/master/assignment1/result) and [my report](https://github.com/coldmanck/CS5242-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning-Assignments/blob/master/assignment1/report.pdf)

Below is the cost and accuracy changing during training of the first network, which is a three-layer fully connected networks.
